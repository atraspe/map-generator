Disclaimer: I do not have any professional background in programming nor software engineering. That said, this is an initiative to get my hands dirty (coding!) to develop my technical skills and gain practical experience. Creating this script is part of an on-going effort to self study Python programming language. Just taking advantage of its use for everyday tasks and, just for fun! :)
