Disclaimer: I do not have any professional background in programming nor software engineering. That said, this is an initiative to get my hands dirty (coding!) to develop my technical skills and gain practical experience. Creating this script is part of an on-going effort to self study Python programming language. Just taking advantage of its use for everyday tasks and, just for fun! :)



# map-generator
Python script (map-gen.py) to generate a non-EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) Standard map based on client's specifications (aka specs), usually in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The generated map will later be used/paired with an EDI map to parse (input) or generate (output) a non-EDI data. This script uses openpyxl python library.

The expectation is that the specs is already well-formed as it is coming out of the QA team's specs-creation process. This script focuses on the creation of the map, rather than validating if the specs has defects or not.
